## Playoff format
The game uses a best-of-three playoff. The score counter is on the top, the blue score with blue, and the red with red. When a player gets a match point, a flame fires under the score.
### Ready Up
Every time a new round has to be played. Both players have to hold down the attack/block button at the same time, and then the round will start after a countdown of 3 seconds. When a player hold down the attack/block button, an indicator and a sound will display on the screen at that players side.
