# Mechanics
## Attack/Block
A player can attack/block once every 1.000 ms attack or block for 500 ms.
## Throw Shuriken (throwing star)
A player can throw a Shuriken every 1.000 ms. A player can max have 3 Shurikans at a time, the player can how many there are left at the top of the screen. A player gets a new Shuriken every 5.000 ms. When the shuriken hits a tile it stops and gets destroyed.
## Playoff format
The game uses a best-of-three playoff. The score counter is on the top, the blue score with blue, and the red with red. When a player gets a match point, a flame fires under the score.
### Ready up
Every time a new round has to be played. Both players have to hold down the attack/block button at the same time, and then the round will start after a countdown of 3 seconds. When a player hold down the attack/block button, an indicator and a sound will display on the screen at that players side.
